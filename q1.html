        <h1>Emphasis and strengthened text</h1>
        You <em>have</em> to <strong>hurry</strong> up! I'm going to be <em>late</em> if we don't <strong>hurry!</strong></section>

    <section id="2">
        <h2>... Separating content from presentation</h2>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        The difference why that "em" is better than "i" is that "em" gives an emphasis of it's contents, while "i" just italicizes a word with no emphasis.
        "strong" gives the content a bigger importance than "b" which only bolds the contents without any importance.
